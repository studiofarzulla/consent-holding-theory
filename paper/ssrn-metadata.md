## Abstract
This paper develops a unified analytical framework for measuring political legitimacy across heterogeneous governance domains. Building on insights from constitutional political economy, social choice theory, and institutional analysis, the framework establishes consent-holding—the mapping from decision domains to those with authority over them—as a structural necessity of collective action. We formalize this intuition through five axioms and five theorems, demonstrating that legitimacy can be operationalized as stakes-weighted consent alignment α(d,t), while friction F(d,t) measures the deviation between outcomes and stakeholder preferences.

The framework bridges normative democratic theory and empirical prediction, generating testable hypotheses about institutional stability. Historical validation examines suffrage expansion, abolition movements, labor rights, and contemporary platform governance, demonstrating how misalignment between stakes and voice generates observable instability. Unlike existing approaches that prescribe ideal institutions, this framework provides analytical tools for measuring legitimacy within any governance structure, enabling systematic comparison across democratic, technocratic, and algorithmic systems.

Computational mechanism comparison via Bayesian learning dynamics across 1000 Monte Carlo runs demonstrates relative performance under adaptive agents: stakes-weighted consent achieves highest final alignment (α = 0.872) with lowest terminal friction (F = 1.5, 94.9% reduction). The framework's domain-specific approach resolves the apparent tension between consent and competence, showing both as complementary dimensions of institutional legitimacy.
