Description
Political legitimacy formalized as stakes-weighted consent alignment (α), enabling systematic comparison across democratic, technocratic, and algorithmic governance systems. Computational validation across 1000 Monte Carlo runs demonstrates consent-based mechanisms achieve 87.2% alignment with 98.5% friction reduction, outperforming plutocratic and purely technocratic alternatives. Historical validation spans suffrage expansion, abolition movements, labor rights, and platform governance rebellions.

Abstract
This paper develops a formal framework for analyzing consent-holding structures, stakeholder friction, and legitimacy dynamics across adversarial environments where competing interests generate structural conflict. From seven minimal axioms (collective decision necessity, outcome constraints, shared reality, preference heterogeneity, stakes heterogeneity, value frame-dependence, and non-zero consent capacity), we derive three core theorems establishing: (1) consent-holding necessity—wherever collective decisions occur, some mapping H_t(d) assigning decision authority must exist; (2) inevitable friction—preference pluralism guarantees that someone's interests will be compromised unless perfect alignment obtains; and (3) minimal absolutism from relativism—even if content-level values are frame-dependent, the structural necessity of consent-holding remains invariant.

We operationalize legitimacy as L = w₁·α + w₂·P, where α measures stakes-weighted consent alignment (the degree to which decision authority tracks material exposure) and P represents domain-specific performance/competence. This formulation makes explicit the fundamental trade-off between participatory consent and technocratic expertise, revealing legitimacy as endogenous constitutional choice rather than exogenous normative specification.

Principal Contributions
(1) Axiomatic foundations: Minimal assumptions yielding structural necessities applicable across political governance, financial markets, algorithmic platforms, and climate negotiations without requiring specific normative commitments.

(2) Computational validation: Four dynamic mechanisms (Bayesian learning with stakes-weighted observation precision, Thompson sampling, Q-learning, gradient descent) demonstrate that consent alignment mechanisms achieve superior long-run performance compared to plutocracy (stakes determine voice directly) and pure technocracy (expertise overrides participation). Monte Carlo simulations (1000 runs, 50 periods) show stakes-weighted consent reaches α=0.872 final alignment with F=1.6 terminal friction (98.5% reduction from initial state).

(3) Historical validation: Case studies across suffrage expansion (gradual consent broadening from property-owning males to universal adult), abolition movements (maximum stakes with zero consent forcing systemic rupture), labor codetermination (friction-driven incorporation of workers into corporate governance), and platform governance rebellions (2010s-present algorithmic authority challenges) demonstrate friction-incorporation dynamics predicted by the framework.

(4) Meta-legitimacy resolution: Weight determination (w₁, w₂) treated as endogenous constitutional-level problem rather than free parameters requiring external specification. Analysis shows different domains justifiably select different weight combinations: emergency medicine prioritizes competence (high w₂), participatory budgeting prioritizes consent (high w₁).

(5) Cross-domain applicability: Framework synthesizes insights from constitutional political economy (Buchanan), social choice theory (Arrow, Sen), stakeholder governance (Freeman), common-pool resources (Ostrom), deliberative democracy (Fishkin), and algorithmic governance (Diakopoulos), providing unified analytical structure.

Practical Implications
For institutional design, results suggest that legitimacy crises emerge predictably when stakes-consent misalignment exceeds tolerance thresholds, and that friction dynamics follow systematic patterns enabling early intervention. For policy evaluation, the framework provides quantitative metrics (α, F, L) for comparing governance mechanisms without requiring consensus on underlying values. For platform governance, findings indicate that algorithmic decision systems require explicit consent-holding structures mapping H_t(d) rather than treating authority assignment as implementation detail.

Methods
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
The analysis employs axiomatic derivation to establish structural necessities from minimal assumptions, computational validation via Monte Carlo simulation (1000 independent runs across 50 time periods), and historical case study analysis examining friction-incorporation dynamics across four domains. Dynamic mechanisms include: (1) Bayesian preference learning with stakes-weighted observation precision τ_obs,i = s*ᵢ, (2) Thompson sampling with stakes-proportional exploration, (3) Q-learning with stakes-modified reward signals, (4) gradient descent on friction minimization objectives. Custom implementations use NumPy for numerical computation, convergence statistics via OLS regression (α_t = β₀ + β₁·t), and robustness validation across parameter variations (prior precision, noise levels, learning rates).

ROBUSTNESS VALIDATION
Beyond primary simulations, we implement multiple robustness checks: alternative dynamic specifications (static cross-sectional baseline, social learning via DeGroot opinion dynamics, endogenous stakes evolution), parameter sensitivity analysis (prior precision τ₀ ∈ [0.1, 10], observation noise σ ∈ [0.05, 0.5], learning rates η ∈ [0.01, 0.5]), crisis regime testing (FTX-style trust collapse scenarios), and plutocracy convergence analysis distinguishing co-option from genuine legitimacy. Primary findings remain qualitatively robust: consent-based mechanisms achieve superior long-run alignment across all specifications, though convergence rates vary with parameterization.

Series information
This work forms part of the Adversarial Systems Research program, which investigates stability, alignment, and friction dynamics in complex systems where competing interests generate structural conflict. The program examines how agents with divergent preferences interact within institutional constraints across multiple domains: political governance (consent-holding and legitimacy), financial markets (cryptocurrency volatility and regulatory responses), human cognitive development (trauma as maladaptive learning from adversarial training environments), and artificial intelligence alignment (multi-agent systems with competing objectives).

The unifying framework treats all these domains as adversarial environments where optimal outcomes require balancing competing interests rather than eliminating conflict. In political systems, this manifests as the tension between stakeholder consent and technocratic competence. In financial markets, it appears as the conflict between regulatory stability and market innovation. In human development, it emerges as the challenge of learning accurate models from noisy or adversarial training data. In AI systems, it surfaces as the alignment problem when multiple agents optimize for different reward functions.

The consent-holding framework provides theoretical foundations applicable across all program domains: anti-money laundering regulatory arbitrage (jurisdictions optimize consent-competence weights differently), portfolio hedging (aligning stakes with decision authority), algorithmic governance (mapping H_t(d) for platform decision systems), and climate negotiations (international consent under competing national interests).

Notes
This paper establishes foundational theory for the Adversarial Systems Research program. The framework's axiomatic structure enables application across domains without requiring consensus on domain-specific values, while the computational validation demonstrates that consent-based mechanisms can achieve superior performance even under realistic learning dynamics and behavioral constraints.

Future extensions may incorporate: (1) dynamic weight determination mechanisms (meta-constitutional choice processes), (2) network structure effects (how topology affects friction propagation), (3) reputation and trust dynamics (repeated interaction effects on consent assignment), (4) heterogeneous competence distributions (expertise asymmetries beyond simple stakes), and (5) information asymmetry effects (hidden action/hidden information moral hazard variants).
