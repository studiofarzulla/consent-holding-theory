RELEASE TITLE:
v1.0.0 - The Doctrine of Consensual Sovereignty (Publication Release)

RELEASE DESCRIPTION:
First publication-ready release of "The Doctrine of Consensual Sovereignty: Quantifying Legitimacy in Adversarial Environments."

## Overview

This release presents a formal framework for analyzing consent-holding structures, stakeholder friction, and legitimacy dynamics across adversarial environments. The framework derives minimal structural necessities from seven axioms, operationalizes legitimacy as stakes-weighted consent alignment, and validates predictions through computational simulation and historical case studies.

## Key Contributions

- **Formal Framework**: Seven axioms yielding three theorems on consent-holding necessity, inevitable friction, and minimal absolutism from value relativism
- **Legitimacy Metric**: Operationalized as weighted combination of consent alignment (α) and performance/competence (P)
- **Computational Validation**: Four dynamic mechanisms (Bayesian learning, Thompson sampling, Q-learning, gradient descent) demonstrate consent alignment superiority over plutocracy and technocracy
- **Historical Validation**: Case studies across suffrage expansion, abolition movements, labor rights, and platform governance rebellions
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Synthesizes constitutional political economy, social choice theory, stakeholder governance, common-pool resources, deliberative democracy, and algorithmic governance
