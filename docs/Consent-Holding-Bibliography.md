## 10. Historical Political Economy (7 entries)

### Long-Run Democratization, State Capacity, Critical Junctures

**Acemoglu, Daron & Robinson, James A. (2012).** *Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty*. New York: Crown Business. (Citations: ~3,000)
- Comprehensive historical analysis showing extractive institutions (low α(d)) produce stagnation whereas inclusive institutions (high α(d)) enable development. Extended framework developed in Narrow Corridor (2019).

**Acemoglu, Daron & Robinson, James A. (2019).** *The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty*. New York: Penguin. (Citations: ~400+)
- RECENT SYNTHESIS: Develops dynamic theory of state-society balance. Democracy emerges when state capacity sufficient for order but society sufficiently powerful to constrain state. Maps to framework's α(d) as equilibrium consent-holding.

**Mahoney, James (2010).** *Colonialism and Postcolonial Development: Spanish America in Comparative Perspective*. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (Citations: ~700)
- Path-dependent analysis showing colonial institutional legacies determine post-independence outcomes. Establishes that initial α(d) boundaries persist across centuries via institutional reproduction.

**Soifer, Hillel D. (2012).** "The Causal Logic of Critical Junctures." *Comparative Political Studies*, 45(12), 1572-1597.
- Formalizes critical juncture theory defining moments when α(d) boundaries become contested and genuinely contingent. Essential for historical institutionalism applications.

**Capoccia, Giovanni & Kelemen, R. Daniel (2007).** "The Study of Critical Junctures: Theory, Narrative, and Counterfactuals." *World Politics*, 59(3), 341-369.
- Theoretical and methodological framework for identifying moments when α(d) restructuring occurs. Shows how small events can have outsized consequences during junctures.

**Evans, Peter B. (1995).** *Embedded Autonomy: States and Industrial Transformation*. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (Citations: ~2,500)
- Comparative analysis showing state capacity enables development when embedded in society. Maps to framework's requirement that high state capacity requires high societal α(d) to prevent extraction.

**Fukuyama, Francis (2014).** *Political Order and Political Decay: From the French Revolution to the Present*. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. (Citations: ~400+)
- Encyclopedic historical account documenting variation in state capacity, rule of law, and accountability. Chronicles how α(d) architecture differs across polities producing divergent stability trajectories.

## 11. Climate Governance (6 entries)

### Future Generations, Climate Assemblies, Intergenerational Justice

**Shue, Henry (1993).** *Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and US Foreign Policy* (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. (Citations: ~1,200)
- Foundational for intergenerational justice. Argues basic rights entail duties to future generations. Maps to framework requirement that α(d) include future stakeholders (currently absent from decision-making).

**Gardiner, Stephen M. (2011).** *A Perfect Moral Storm: The Ethical Tragedy of Climate Change*. Oxford: Oxford University Press. (Citations: ~600)
- Documents "problem of moral distance": future generations cannot participate in decisions affecting them. Central problem: α_future_t(d) ≈ 0. Shows climate requires institutional innovation for intergenerational α(d).

**UK Climate Assembly (2020).** *Climate Assembly UK: Report*. https://www.climateassembly.uk/
- Actual deliberative assembly representing UK public on climate policy. Shows structured deliberation can aggregate diverse preferences including concern for future generations. Practical model for intergenerational α(d).

**Lorenzoni, Irene; Nicholson-Cole, Sophie & Whitmarsh, Lorraine (2007).** "Barriers Perceived to Engaging with Climate Reduction Strategies." *Global Environmental Change*, 17(3-4), 445-459.
- Documents psychological barriers to climate action including temporal distance bias. Suggests α(d) structures can overcome present bias through deliberation.

**Intergenerational Foundation (2024).** "Intergenerational Justice and Climate Change: Comparative Policy Review." London: IF.
- Recent policy review documenting how nations institutionalize intergenerational representation. Germany's environment ombudsman, New Zealand's Future Commissioner models. Documents emerging α(d) innovations for future stakeholders.

**Wells, Rachel; Howarth, Candice & Brand-Correa, Luiza I. (2021).** "Are Citizen Juries and Assemblies on Climate Change Driving Democratic Climate Policymaking?" *Climatic Change*, 168, 5. DOI: 10.1007/s10584-021-03218-6. (Citations: ~15)
- Recent empirical study of UK climate assemblies (Leeds, Oxford) finding deliberative processes increase public mandate for action but impact on actual policy contingent on institutional embedding. Validates T4.

## 12. Legitimacy Theory (6 entries)

### Input/Output/Throughput, Authority vs. Legitimacy

**Scharpf, Fritz W. (1999).** *Governing in Europe: Effective and Democratic?* Oxford: Oxford University Press. (Citations: ~2,500)
- FOUNDATIONAL LEGITIMACY FRAMEWORK: Distinguishes input legitimacy (citizen participation) and output legitimacy (policy effectiveness). Shows both necessary; neither sufficient. Maps directly to framework's α(d) (input) and performance outcomes (output).

**Schmidt, Vivien A. (2013).** "Democracy and Legitimacy in the European Union Revisited." *Journal of Common Market Studies*, 51(1), 131-147.
- Extends Scharpf framework adding throughput legitimacy (procedural quality). Documents that input and output alone cannot legitimate governance in multi-level systems. Validates need for process legitimacy alongside α(d).

**Weber, Max (1978).** *Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology* (Vol. 1). Berkeley: UC Press. (Citations: >50,000)
- FOUNDATIONAL: Distinguishes rational-legal, traditional, and charismatic legitimacy. Shows multiple bases for authority beyond consent. Framework can incorporate as sources of α(d) in different domains.

**Raz, Joseph (1986).** *The Morality of Freedom*. Oxford: Oxford University Press. (Citations: ~2,000)
- Philosophical analysis distinguishing legitimate authority (right to rule) from effective authority (capacity to rule). Shows legitimacy = pre-emption thesis satisfied. Maps to framework's distinction between formal α(d) and actual influence.

**Peter, Fabienne (2010).** "Political Legitimacy." *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/political-legitimacy/. (Citations: ~586 in version 2010)
- Comprehensive philosophical survey of legitimacy concepts. Documents competing theories of legitimacy basis (consent, desert, consequences, procedure). Validates framework's pluralistic approach to measuring α(d).

**Bovens, Mark; Goodin, Robert E. & Schillemans, Thomas (Eds.) (2014).** *The Oxford Handbook of Public Accountability*. Oxford: Oxford University Press. (Citations: ~300+)
- Systematic treatment of accountability as legitimacy component. Shows legitimacy requires not just α(d) but answerability mechanisms. Complements framework's T3 prediction.
